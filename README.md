# NeuralNetwork
This Neural Network class definition and training algorithm was created by Nadia Panossian at the Clean Energy Systems Integration Lab at Washington State University. 

This class definition and training algorithm is generalized to train to any number of inputs, outputs, or layers. 

The purpose was to create a neural network which could be used for dispatch optimization of microgrids, and forecasting of power demands. The research relating to these findings have been reported in the thesis entitled "Complementary Quadratic Programming and Artificial Neural Network for Computationally Efficient Microgrid Dispatch Optimization with Unit Commitment" which can be found at http://www.dissertations.wsu.edu/Thesis/Spring2018/n_panossian_051718.pdf

These functions and class definitions have been tested in MATLAB2016 and Python3.6.
